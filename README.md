# Clockworks
Code and Locale Files for the Clockworks project on Resonite (part of MMC 26)

To become a collaborator for translation proofreading/editing/suggestions, contact Jackalgirl on Resonite or in the Creator Jam Discord server.  And many thanks in advance for your help!

**Localization Tips**
For in-game references, make sure you're referencing the official Locale files: https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Locale/

You can use the references below to search on any given language locale file to find out how it's referenced in the game.  If you search for a reference and it comes up missing, this means that this particular reference hasn't been translated yet.  If you know what it should be, consider proposing it as a change to the file so that the Resonite team can implement it into the game!  Please make sure you're following the instructions on how to submit suggestions/corrections/updates at https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Locale/ if you do so, and **thank you for contributing** (good translation work is time-consuming)!
